Collection of codes for medical imaging

## Attention-Gated-Networks_auxiliary
Working on Attention-Gated-Networks from https://github.com/ozan-oktay/Attention-Gated-Networks,
you might want to run the algorithm on the original datasets. One of them is PANCREAS CT-82 which
can be found from https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Pancreas-CT.

The .dcm files store 2D slices. This code combines (and normalize) the slices of each patient 
into 3D volume. Each patient is coded as PANCREAS_0001, PANCREAS_0002 etc.

Usage. You can run the following in the command line. Note that tests are conducted in Windows 10, python 3.6
`python ctpan.py -h`
